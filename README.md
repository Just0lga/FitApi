# 🏋️ FitApi

I developed a backend system to support the transformation of a specific workout program I personally use into a functional mobile application. The goal was to create a scalable and structured API that could serve as the foundation for a fitness app, allowing users to follow training routines, track progress, and manage their workout data efficiently.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- ASP.NET Core for API development  
- Entity Framework Core for database operations  
- PostgreSQL as the database  
- Swagger for API documentation and testing  
- JWT Authentication for secure access
